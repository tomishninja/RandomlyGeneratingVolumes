# Randomly Generating Volumes for HCI Research
A system designed to generate randomly based volumes for research, the paper describing this work has yet to be published but will be presented at ISMAR. It will be published as Generating Pseudo Random Volumes for Volumetric Research.

This system presents a modular system to create volumes randomly designed for Human User Interaction Studies, specifically designed for AR and VR HCI research but not limited to it. Example code to render these objects is provided.

## Outputs
- Various outputs are achievable using this system. You can directly create some JSON code that will allow you to create a user study that will be able to with both the visualization data and various answer data provided. 
- The system also contains two interfaces (desktop and Mixed Reality)
